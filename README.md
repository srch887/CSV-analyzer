# Tools in Data Science - Project 2
## Code description
The code file(autolysis.py) uses an LLM (GPT 4o mini) to generate code for plotting graphs like:
- Correlation matrix
- Bar graph for counting missing values
- Histograms of all categorical columns (Columns with more than 20 categories are ignored)

The code also generates a summary of the data and provides insights and datasets
