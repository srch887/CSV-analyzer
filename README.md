# Tools in Data Science - Project 2
## Code description
The code file(autolysis.py) uses an LLM (GPT 4o mini) to generate code for plotting graphs like:
- Correlation matrix (Using code generated by an LLM API during runtime)
- Box plots of all numerical columns
- Histograms of all columns (Categorical columns with more than 15 categories are ignored)

The code also generates a summary of the data and provides insights and datasets
