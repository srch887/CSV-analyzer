## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Data Improvement**:
   - Focus on filling in missing values for ISBN, original title, and language codes to enhance the dataset's usability.
   - Consider establishing a process to verify and update author information since the authorship can impact users' decisions and recommendations.

2. **Analysis of Historical Trends**:
   - Investigate how average ratings differ across publication years to identify trends in reader preferences and how they evolve over time.
   - Conduct a deeper exploration of why older books tend to receive fewer ratings.

3. **User Engagement**:
   - Promote books with high ratings and low ratings count to encourage users to engage with highly rated but less popular titles.
   - Utilize the correlation between ratings and text reviews to pilot initiatives that encourage users to leave text reviews after rating.

4. **Enhance Metadata**:
   - Enrich the dataset by adding information about genres, reviews, and awards, which could improve recommendation systems and user experience.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visual reports to showcase top-rated books, emerging authors, and trends in reader preferences over the years.
